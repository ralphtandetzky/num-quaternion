# Instructions for AI Agents working on the repository

- Always consider the info from the `README.md` and linked documents.
- Don't be so agreeable. If you think something is not a good practice, say it.
  If you think something is missing, say it. If you think something is not
  clear, say it. Discuss it with me.
- Discuss and provide options before altering architecture or introducing new
  dependencies.
- Ask questions to get clarifications - especially if I ask for something that
  is questionable from design or engineering perspective before you implement
  something.
- After making changes, check for problems using the build task.
- In order to avoid inconsistencies and bugs, be on the lookout for code and
  configuration that can be reused, or refactored to be made reusable, and then
  do it. But do maintain architectural boundaries.
